file generated by https://github.com/bitovi/syn.
behat/MinkSelenium2Driver hasn't been updated for past 2 years and there has been recent fixes in syn.js
So we are including syn.js manually.

Steps to generate the minified version of syn.js
================================================

* Checkout the project with our local modifications
* cd to the directory
* npm install (run this with sudo, if this fails with access error)
* npm install -g grunt-cli
* grunt build
* The resulting minified file will be stored in dist/syn.min.js
